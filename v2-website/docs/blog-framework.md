## Framework

In order to keep the tone and layout of each article consistent, we're going to use the following framework.  It's drawn from the sections used when detailing a [lab  experiment](https://www.monash.edu/rlo/assignment-samples/science/science-writing-a-lab-report).

## Abstract

    provides an overview of the report content, including findings and conclusions
    usually the last part of the document to be written
    may not be required in a short lab report

## Introduction

    provides appropriate background to the scenario and briefly explains any relevant
    theories states the problem and/or hypothesis and concisely states the objectives
    of the example system

## Problem

    describes a sample topology of a typical system and the interaction between tiers
    where pertinent, along     with the use cases and problem(s) that are likely to
    be encountered

## Solution

    describes a modification of the previous system with a description of how the
    previous problems are resolved

## Conclusion

    reminds the reader what problem was being investigated
    summarises the findings in relation to the problem/hypothesis
    briefly identifies big-picture implications of the findings (Answers the question "So What?")

## References

    lists the publication details of all sources cited in the text, allowing readers to locate sources quickly and easily
    usually follows a specific referencing style
