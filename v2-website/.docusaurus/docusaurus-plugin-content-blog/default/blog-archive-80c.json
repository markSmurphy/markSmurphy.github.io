      "content": "## Understanding high availability in complex systems, and how to calculate them\n\nWhen working on complex, distributed, multi-tiered systems there are always certain non-functional requirements that the solution should achieve.\nPerformance and resilience can be a focus of a given sprint team at a component level, but the overall availability of the system as a whole needs a more holistic view.\n\nIn this article we scrutinise real-world deployments to understand:\n\n* The relationship between complexity and availability.\n* How to work out the theoretical availability of a system.\n* How to monitor the actual availability.\n* How to achieve 99.99% availability.\n\n---\n\n### The relationship between complexity and availability\n\nThe complexity we're referring to here is *not* complexity of the code nor the complexity of the functional solution.\nBy `complexity` we mean the non-functional complexity that come hand-in-hand with multi-tiered micro-service solutions.\n\nAs an end-to-end system becomes more complex, it also becomes, probabilistically, less available.\n\nTo understand this better, let's start off with a simple topology and add complexity as we go:\n\n![Simple Topology](/img/High-Availability.01.jpg)\n\nIn the example above we have a client-side application installed which connects directly to a cloud hosted database.\nThe database is hosted in the cloud, and the cloud provider's [SLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-level_agreement) states an availability of 99%.\nOr, to put it another way, it could be unavailable for 1% of the time; which equates to 3.65 days in a year.\n\nIf this database is unavailable then our whole system is down. So our system also has an availability of 99%\n\n> An SLA of 99% is awfully low, but we're keeping this example simple and rounding up to whole numbers.\n\nThere are very good reasons why don't design [thick-client](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thick_client&redirect=yes) applications anymore, so let's make this a little more realistic by changing it to be browser based."
